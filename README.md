CardFoldr is a tool to help you convert a PDF of card grids (say, 3x3 cards per page, several pages of fronts and one page of backs) into a gutterfold PDF: card fronts and backs on the same page, with a foldline down the middle for easy double sided alignment.

It is meant to help with building print'n'play games.
